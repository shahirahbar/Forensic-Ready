# What are the best practices to ensure a Windows OS is forensic-ready?
In the Linux operating system, various tools can be used for forensic analysis. These tools utilize system logs and files. Therefore, to ensure a Linux system is forensically sound, it is essential to verify the integrity of these files and ensure they are stored appropriately, with logs backed up in external tools.

## Important Log Sources  
Ensure the following log sources are active and the related files are created in the specified paths. Periodically back up these logs on a separate system.  

| Log Sources | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| /var/log/auth.log | Logs related to authentication and system login |
| /var/log/syslog | General system logs |
| /var/log/kern.log | Kernel-related logs |
| /var/log/dmesg | Logs related to system boot |
| /var/log/apt/history.log | Logs related to software package installation and removal |
| /var/log/ufw.log | Logs related to the UFW firewall |
| /var/log/apache2/access.log | Apache server access logs |
| /var/log/apache2/error.log | Apache server error logs |
| /var/log/mysql/error.log | MySQL error logs |
| /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log | PostgreSQL logs |
| /var/log/cron | Logs related to scheduled tasks (Cron Jobs) |
| /var/log/maillog | Logs related to emails |
| /var/log/audit/audit.log | Logs related to Auditd |

## Important Security Logs  
Ensure the following logs are active and recording necessary information.  

| Log | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| /var/log/auth.log | User logins and logouts, failed access attempts, exploited access |
| /var/log/faillog | Logs related to failed login attempts |
| /var/log/secure | Security logs related to various services |
| /var/log/audit/audit.log | For systems using Auditd |

## Network Logs  
Network logs can provide important information about network activities on the system.  

| Log | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| /var/log/ufw.log | Logs related to the UFW firewall |
| /var/log/syslog | General system logs, including network activities |
| /var/log/networking/ | Logs related to network services |

## Application Logs  
Some applications have their own logs that can be useful for forensic analysis.  

| Log | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| /var/log/apache2/access.log | Apache server access logs |
| /var/log/apache2/error.log | Apache server error logs |
| /var/log/mysql/error.log | MySQL error logs |
| /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log | PostgreSQL logs |

## File System Logs  
File system logs can provide information about file changes and access.  

| Log | Description |

| /var/log/ufw.log | Logs related to the UFW firewall |
| /var/log/snort/ | Logs related to the Snort intrusion detection system |
| /var/log/audit/audit.log | Logs related to Auditd (for systems using Auditd) |

Logs Related to Management Systems  
Logs related to management systems such as Cron Jobs can provide important information about system management activities.  

| Log | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| /var/log/cron | Logs related to scheduled tasks (Cron Jobs) |

## Logs Related to Database Systems  
Logs related to database systems such as MySQL and PostgreSQL can provide important information about database activities.
